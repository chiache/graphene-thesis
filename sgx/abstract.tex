\begin{abstract}

\intel{} \sgx{} hardware enables
applications to protect themselves from potentially-malicious
OSes or hypervisors.  
In cloud computing and other systems, many users and applications
could benefit from SGX. % protections.
Unfortunately, current applications will not work out-of-the-box on SGX.
Although previous work has shown that %, in principle,
a library OS can execute unmodified 
applications on SGX, a belief has developed that 
a library OS will be ruinous for performance and TCB size,
making 
application code modification
an implicit prerequisite to adopting SGX.

%Despite the fast-growing interest in \sgx{},
%%Despite a surge of research and development interest in \sgx{},
%adopting the hardware in existing applications has been far from efficient,
%due to the porting effort for overcoming the limitations of legacy frameworks.
%%% Current approaches to legacy application suuport on \sgx{}

%%% or packaging all binaries into an encrypted archive to be provisioned from a remote server (Haven).
%%% \fixmedp{is this right?  What about Haven?}\fixme{Try to be clear}
%%% These requirements make adopting \sgx{} unstraightforward to unprofessional users.
%%% Moreover, COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) applications cannot be directly

%%% due to difficulty of attesting off-the-shelf binaries

%\fixmedp{I would rephrase these as problems, rather than benefits, but I don't understand these points yet:

%}

%As existing OS support for \sgx{} requires custom-making applications,
%Not only does Graphene simplify the effort to port an application
%to \sgx{}, but it also introduces benefits including:
%The COTS support not only minimizes the porting effort of an application to merely configuration,
%but introduces benefits such as:
%Using either the \sdk{} or a shielding system
%(e.g., \haven{}~\cite{baumann14haven}),
%the procedure of porting an application to \sgx{} mostly requires centralized effort---one trusted user or entity
%has to be responsible of customizing, packaging and signing the application code to run with \sgx{}, as well as maintaining the correspondent validation and provisioning services.
%%porting of existing applications has been far from efficient,
%%due to the bottleneck on developers to
%%customize, package and authenticate the application code
%%to comply with the legacy frameworks. % (either \sdk{} or \sgx{} \libos{}es).
%%Besides relying on applications tailored to \sgx{},
%Many users %who own an \sgx{}-enabled infrastructure will
%can benefit from a framework that
%seamlessly transits COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) applications to \sgx{} without bottlenecking on porting procedure. 
%%and keeps developers from the critical path of the porting process.
%Some immediate reasons for targeting COTS applications on \sgx{} include
%(1) securing close-source applications only available in stores.
%to facilitate porting executables that heavily rely on dynamic linking (e.g., Apache, OpenJDK),
%and (3) to create throwaway containers for applications abruptly escalated to processing sensitive data, and preserve the attestation information for auditing.
%For reusing legacy applications,
%\sysname{} has the least restriction and human intervention
%compared to its alternatives.


%programming this hardware is cumbersome because of many missing OS abstractions.
%This is fundamental: in order to secure applications from an untrusted OS,
%some risky OS interaction models must be constrained, breaking backward-compatibility.
%%developers often find programming for \sgx{} cumbersome,
%%due to the lack of legacy OS abstractions and APIs in the current infrastructure.
%%To address the problem,
%Developers need a platform with sufficient OS compatibility to get existing code running
%in an enclave quickly (but without defeating the purpose of using \sgx{}), so they can focus on
%their effort on further hardening their applications with other \sgx{} features, such as remote attestation or finer-grained partitioning.
%%so most of an application and its supporting libraries can be reused inside an SGX enclave.
%%The cutting-edge Software Guard Extension (\sgx{}) is at the point of being universally launched
%%in upcoming \intel{} processors.
%%However, the software development for applying this technology, at wherever opportunities lie,
%%falls behind the introduction of the hardware.
%%The main obstacle is
%%the concentration and expertise required
%%for developing software specialized for \sgx{}.
%%As an answer to the issue,


%This paper focuses on Linux COTS applications, to benefit the majority of public clouds
%that use Linux as the backbone OS.
%For securing Linux COTS applications with \sgx{}, two critical challenges present in the legacy frameworks.
%First, Linux executables are commonly linked with shared, local libraries,
%while \sgx{} requires the enclave code to be static and authenticated ahead-of-time.
%%First, for an executable composed of dynamically-linked, regular binaries,
%%the framework must launch the execution with \sgx{} and allow authentication by trusted provisioners.
%Second, the legacy frameworks are not sufficiently compatible with the features
%that many Linux applications depend on.
%A key feature that has been missing is the support of multi-process applications---i.e., ones that \fork{} the isolated execution into another enclave---while retaining the integrity guarantee.

This paper demonstrates that 
these concerns are exaggerated, and 
that a fully-featured
library OS can rapidly deploy unmodified applications on SGX
with overheads
comparable to applications modified to use ``shim'' layers.
%This paper presents \sysname{}, a framework for running unmodified, Linux COTS applications in enclaves.
%This paper describes \sysname{}, a framework for transiting Linux COTS applications to SGX,
%and decentralizing the effort of packaging application code, authenticating benign applications, and building the trust in provisioning services.
We present a port of Graphene to SGX,
as well as a number of improvements to make the security benefits
of SGX more usable, such as integrity support for dynamically-loaded libraries,
and secure multi-process support.

%(i.e., {\em Iago attacks}).
The performance overheads of \sysname{} range from matching a Linux
process to less than $2\times$ in most single-process cases;
these overheads are largely attributable to current SGX hardware 
or missed opportunities to optimize Graphene internals, 
and are not necessarily fundamental to leaving the application unmodified.

%like Linux system calls.

\sysname{} is open-source and has been used concurrently by other groups

%extends the \graphene{} \libos{}---\graphene{} sustains a narrow interface
%to the untrusted OS, retaining the isolation benefits of an \sgx{} \libos{}.
%Despite this narrow interface, \graphene{} supports and secures many challenging
%Linux features across \sgx{} enclaves, including fork(), signals, namespaces, and other IPC.
%%Below the \libos{}, a narrow interface is exported
%%for integration with rest of the application,
%%and fully configurable for self-validating the inputted resources.
%%The goal of \sysname{} is a framework
%%for loading natively-developed Linux executables into isolated environment,
%%regardless of the deployment and integration models of applications.
%%First, we remove the prerequisite of a trusted server from the dynamic loading process,
%%and use truly application-dependent measurements to establish trustworthy execution.
%%This approach facilitates many options, %deployment and integration options, 
%%Using the multi-process support of \graphene{},
%%our platform contributes several integration options over prior \sgx{} \libos{}es,
%%including process-to-enclave integration, and multi-enclave applications.
%For each application, we make the signatures of \sgx{} enclaves reflect the loaded binaries,
%based on analyzing application dependencies across processes---allowing third-party provisioning servers to attest the execution.

%In addition, by using off-the-shelf \intel{} processors for development and evaluation,

%During the development,
%we identify several pivotal factors to the SGX performance,

%and provide insights for developers to tune their applications.
%For instance, memory usage impacts the start-up time and paging overhead,

%In summary, we expect \sysname{} to become the foundation of software development

%\intel{} \sgx{} enclaves isolate applications
%from untrusted system stacks, as well as attacks to hardware or firmware.
%Previous works have shown how to
%use \sgx{} to isolate a complete, single-process,
%legacy application,
%or a small piece of it---in a single enclave.
%The open problem this work addresses is how to span an application,
%as multi-process and with multiple security principles,
%across several enclaves.
%Due to the lack of tools for developers to partition
%a large application,
%the default approach to using enclaves leads to a large trusted computing base (TCB),
%thereby increasing the risk of exploitable vulnerabilities.
%A multi-enclave model splits the TCB, but introduces
%challenges such as
%extending integrity guarantees to cloned enclaves;
%%minimizing per-enclave provisioning costs;
%and enforcing security policies on shared in-enclave abstractions.

%% \sgx{} hardware can isolate security-critical components of
%% applications in a protected memory space called an {\em enclave}.
%% In an enclave, the CPU guarantees confidentiality and integrity,
%% and offers remote attestation.


%Hardware-isolated execution brought by \sgx{}
%allows applications to guard their most critical security components
%in a sanctuarized memory space ({\it enclave}),
%with confidentiality and integrity guaranteed and attested by processors.
%% Recent works like \haven{}~\cite{baumann14haven} use \libos{}es to
%% facilitate migration of native Windows applications to \sgx{},
%% providing ease of use and
%% a sensible security model to build up the trust for applications
%% running in the cloud.
%% However, users of \haven{} must tolerate the limitations that
%% only single-process Windows applications are supported,
%% and unpacking of application binaries must alway be provisioned
%% from remote servers.
%% Moreover, lack of methods to partition the applications
%% causes large trusted computing base in enclaves,
%% leading to risks of exposing security vulnerabilities to attackers.

%a library OS that creates and coordinates the multi-enclave environment,
%to isolate legacy Linux multi-process applications.
