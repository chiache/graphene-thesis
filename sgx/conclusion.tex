\section{Conclusion}

This paper demonstrates that the costs of running an unmodified application in SGX on a library OS are
marginal compared to thinner shims.
The major costs of using SGX are still hardware limitations of SGX.
As SGX and similar technologies mature, these design choices may have more impact.
In the interim, \sysname{} serves as a simple, open-source tool to quickly bring up
existing applications on SGX, and then incrementally adapt the code to improve performance and security on SGX.
%\fixme{Mona suggests dropping this}
%We believe the \sysname{} design is sufficiently general that porting applications to AMD's PSP
%features should only require porting the PAL.
%\fixme{Mona suggest adding this argument:
%``Graphene-SGX can provide support for running unmodified applications on SGX that provide encryption and integrity Vs SEV that can run unmodified applications, but provides only encryption but no integrity guarantees.''}
