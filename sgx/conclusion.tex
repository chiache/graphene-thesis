\papersection{Conclusion}

This paper demonstrates that the costs of running an unmodified application in \sgx{} on a library OS are
marginal compared to thinner shims.
The major costs of using \sgx{} are still hardware limitations of \sgx{}.
As \sgx{} and similar technologies mature, these design choices may have more impact.
In the interim, \sysname{} serves as a simple, open-source tool to quickly bring up
existing applications on \sgx{}, and then incrementally adapt the code to improve performance and security on \sgx{}.
%\fixme{Mona suggests dropping this}
%We believe the \sysname{} design is sufficiently general that porting applications to AMD's PSP
%features should only require porting the PAL.
%\fixme{Mona suggest adding this argument:
%``Graphene-\sgx{} can provide support for running unmodified applications on \sgx{} that provide encryption and integrity Vs SEV that can run unmodified applications, but provides only encryption but no integrity guarantees.''}
