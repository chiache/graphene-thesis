\section{Summary}

This chapter describes \graphenesgx{},
a port of the \graphene{} \libos{} on the security-centered, Intel SGX platforms.
SGX facilitates the protection of applications
against the whole untrusted system stack ranging from off-chip hardware to the OS,
but imposes several restrictions to running unmodified applications.
\graphenesgx{} removes the restrictions
by servicing Linux \linuxapis{} inside an in-enclave \libos{} instance and defining an enclave interface with explicit checks for responses from the untrusted OS.
Compared with other thin, shielding layers~\cite{osdi16scone,shinde17panoply}, \graphenesgx{} shields a large range of Linux \linuxapis{},
for the typical applications targeted by the cloud,
without extending the host ABI that an enclave needs to check.



\graphenesgx{} shows the possibility
of protecting an unmodified application and \libos{} using three shielding approaches.
First,
