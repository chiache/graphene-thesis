\caption{File system performance. The host file system is EXT4. Comparison is among (1) native Linux processes; (2) \graphene{} on Linux host, both without and with \seccomp{} filter ({\bf +SC}) and reference monitor ({\bf +RM}); (3) \graphenesgx{}.
System call latency is in microseconds, and lower is better.
System call throughput is in operations per second, and higher is better. 
Overheads are relative to Linux; negative overheads indicate improvement.}

Figure~\ref{tab:eval:libos:lmbench-fs}
lists the latency or throughput of several system calls
for accessing an isolated host file system mounted into the \thelibos{} instance, or a {\bf chroot} file system.
