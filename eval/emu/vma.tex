\begin{table}[t!b!]

\caption{System call benchmark results based on \lmbench{} 2.5. Comparison is among (1) native Linux processes, (2) \graphene{} \picoprocs{} on Linux host, both without and with SECCOMP filter ({\bf +SC}) and reference monitor ({\bf +RM}), and (3) \graphene{} in \sgx{} enclaves.
System call latency is in microseconds, and lower is better.
System call bandwidth and throughput are in megabytes per second and operations per second, respectively, and higher is better. 
%The file system is measured in thousands operations per second, and higher is better.
Overheads are relative to Linux \linuxversion{}; negative overheads indicate improved performance.}
