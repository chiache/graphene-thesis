\caption{Single-process system call performance based on \lmbench{}. Comparison is among (1) native Linux processes; (2) \graphene{} \picoprocs{} on Linux host, both without and with \seccomp{} filter ({\bf +SC}) and reference monitor ({\bf +RM}); (3) \graphene{} in \sgx{} enclaves.
System call latency is in microseconds, and lower is better.
Overheads are relative to Linux; negative overheads indicate improvement.}
