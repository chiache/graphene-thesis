This section evaluates the cost
of emulating Linux \linuxapis{} inside of the \graphene{} \libos{},
or \thelibos{}.
The evaluation is based on benchmark results
of Linux \linuxapis{} inside a \picoproc{},
since the Linux system call table is the main target that \thelibos{} emulates
as a guest.
The Linux \linuxapis{} performance
on \thelibos{}
is affected by the emulation strategies
or the underlying host abstractions (i.e., \hostapis{})
that \thelibos{}
selects to implement \linuxapis{}.
This section
shows the emulation overhead of \thelibos{}
by comparing the benchmark results
of Linux \linuxapis{} in a \picoproc{} with the native \linuxapi{ } performance in a Linux process
and the related \hostapis{}, as evaluated in Section~\ref{sec:eval:pal}.
Finally,
the evaluation shows that with the right emulation strategies,
\thelibos{} can achieve acceptable performance at the Linux \linuxapi{} level,
which also contributes as an important factor to
application performance.
