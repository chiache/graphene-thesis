\begin{table}[t!b!]
\input{tables/lmbench-streams}
\caption{Network socket and pipe performance. Comparison is among (1) native Linux processes; (2) \graphene{} on Linux host, both without and with \seccomp{} filter ({\bf +SC}) and reference monitor ({\bf +RM}); (3) \graphenesgx{}.
System call latency is in microseconds, and lower is better.
System call bandwidth is in megabytes per second, and higher is better. 
%The file system is measured in thousands operations per second, and higher is better.
Overheads are relative to Linux; negative overheads indicate improvement.}
