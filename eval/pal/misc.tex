\papersubsection{Exception handling}


%This section evaluates the performance of handling an exception from the host OS or hardware,
%including installing an exception handler,
%interrupting a running thread
%with \palcall{ThreadInterrupt} (raising an \code{INTERRUPT} exception in the target thread),
%and catching a hardware protection fault
%(writing to a read-only address).






The exception handling features in \thehostabi{} include
handler installation
and delivering exceptions to the guest.
On each PAL implementation,
installing an exception handler is much cheaper than assigning an exception handler
in a Linux native process
(Figure~\ref{fig:eval:pal:sig-latency}),
since \thehostabi{} simply stores a function pointer for the handler.
Exception delivery, however,
is restricted by host OS or hardware constraints,
and a user-space
implementation tends to be less efficient
than the host OS.

%Both the Linux PAL and \sgx{} PAL implement an elaborate exception delivery scheme
%which gracefully handles
%corner cases
%of hardware or OS-triggered exceptions.
%One corner case
%that the PALs handle
%is an internal exception,
%which happens during either a \hostapi{} or the host exception handler in the PAL.
%The PALs
%detect these internal exceptions
%and roll back the stack
%to the latest guest frame.
%As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:eval:pal:sig-latency},
%delivering a memory fault on the Linux PAL
%is up to 273\%
%more expensive than delivering a \code{SIGSEGV} signal
%to a native Linux process.


Without virtualizing interrupt handlers,
a hardware exception
on the Linux PAL are delivered into the host Linux kernel
and then sent to the process as a signal.
The host Linux kernel
also delivers
OS-trigger exceptions,
such as interruption from another thread
and blocked system calls,
as different signals (e.g., \code{SIGUSR1} and \code{SIGSYS}) to the process.
Processing these
host signals involves several expensive operations,
including
checking the ranges of interrupted instructions
and passing the register files
to the guest exception handlers.
For delivering a memory fault,
the overheads add up to \roughly{}273\%.
%Similar overheads are observed on the delivery of other exceptions.
%Delivering other exceptions can expect
%a similar overhead.

interrupting a running thread with signals (on Linux) or \palcall{ThreadInterrupt} on the PALs; (c) catching a memory protection fault. Lower is better. The comparison is between (1) signals on Linux; (2) the Linux PAL, with and without a \seccomp{} filter ({\bf +SC}) and reference monitor ({\bf +RM}); (3) the \sgx{} PAL.}

%Figure~\ref{fig:eval:pal:sig-latency} (a)
%shows the latency of installing an exception handler in either the Linux or \sgx{} PAL, compared with
%\syscall{sigaction} in a Linux process.
%The result
%shows that regardless the PAL is running in a regular \picoproc{} or an enclave,
%installing an exception handling
%in the PAL
%is much lower than install a signal handler
%on Linux,
%because the \hostapi{} does not have to take any system call or enclave exits.


%Figure~\ref{fig:eval:pal:sig-latency}
%measures the latency of delivering an interrupt and a memory protection exception
%to a thread in the process.



%Figure~\ref{fig:eval:pal:sig-latency} (b)
%shows the latency of interrupting a running thread
%and raising an exception
%in the target thread, compared with delivering a \code{SIGUSR1} signal in a Linux process.
%Thread interruption on the Linux PAL
%is slightly slower than
%delivering a \code{SIGUSR1} signal,
%by \roughly{}25\% without \seccomp{} filter and reference monitor, or \roughly{}32\% with \seccomp{} filter and reference monitor.
%On the \sgx{} PAL,
%the latency of thread interrupt
%is much higher, due to the cost of extra thread exits.
%Interrupting a thread running on the \sgx{} PAL
%is \roughly{}3.1\x{} shower than delivering a \code{SIGUSR1} signal in a Linux process.



%Figure~\ref{fig:eval:pal:sig-latency} (b)
%shows the latency of catching a memory protection fault,
%compared with handling
%a \code{SIGSEGV} signal in a Linux process.
%On the Linux, handling a hardware fault is \roughly{}2.6\x{} slower than handling a \code{SIGSEGV} signal on Linux;
%such an overhead
%is primarily caused by delivering
%the exception information to the guest, including the faulting register contexts.
%Figure~\ref{fig:eval:pal:sig-latency} (b)
%also shows that catching a hardware fault inside an enclave
%is even more expensive
%than thread interruption, by nearly 60\%.
%The reason of such a dramatic difference is that
%interrupting a thread only causes the interrupt thread to exit and enter the enclave once,
%whereas handling a hardware fault
%requires the faulting thread to exit and enter the enclave twice,
%in order to reset the in-enclave buffer
%for preserving the faulting contexts.
