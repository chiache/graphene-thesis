\subsection{Page management}
\label{sec:eval:pal:memory}


This section evaluates the performance of virtual page allocation and deallocation
using \thehostabi{}.
The latency of creating or destroying a virtual memory area
may differ among PAL implementations
due to different memory management models.
The Linux PAL, for instance, has a memory management model
similar to Linux,
backed by demand paging.
The SGX PAL, on the other hand, has to preallocate all pages at loading time.
Although the SGX driver still swaps enclave pages,
the latency of page-in and page-out can be up to 40,000 cycles~\cite{orenbach17eleos},
%than normal page-in and page-out latency,
and the current SGX hardware does not allow dynamically adding pages
to an enclave.
As a result, the SGX PAL includes an in-enclave memory allocator
which manages unused enclave pages
and assigns the pages to memory allocation requests.
To evaluate
the differences of memory management models,
the experiments
include two scenarios:
(1) simply allocating and deallocating virtual pages;
(2) allocating virtual pages,
accessing the beginning of every pages,
and then deallocating the pages.
For each scenario,
the benchmark tests with different memory mapping sizes.

The comparison is between (1) \syscall{mmap} and \syscall{munmap} on Linux; (2) \palcall{VirtMemAlloc} and \palcall{VirtMemFree} on the Linux PAL, with and without a \seccomp{} filter ({\bf +SC}) and reference monitor ({\bf +RM}); (3) the same \hostapis{} on the SGX PAL, with and without zeroing the pages before use ({\bf +Zero}).}

\end{figure*}


Figure~\ref{fig:eval:pal:mmap-latency} (a)
shows the latency of
simple allocation and deallocation.
Linux and the Linux PAL
show similar latency for allocating and deallocating any numbers
of virtual pages,
as the cost of updating the page table
in the host kernel.
For the Linux PAL, the latency
of \palcall{VirtMemAlloc} and  \palcall{VirtMemFree} is 50--80\% higher
than \syscall{mmap} and \syscall{munmap} on Linux
(the overheads of \seccomp{} filter and reference monitor is negligible).
For the SGX PAL,
the latency of allocation and deallocation
is much lower,
at \roughly{}10\% of the latency of \syscall{mmap} and \syscall{munmap}.
%since the enclave simply
%updates the bookkeeping inside the page allocator
%and never exits the enclave.
However,
since SGX doesn't guarantee the initial state of unmeasured enclave pages,
the SGX PAL needs to zero all pages
before passing to the guest.
Accessing the pages after allocation
may cause cache misses and enclave page swapping,
when the allocation size
is larger than the size of last-level cache.
The result shows that,
if the SGX PAL zeros pages after allocation,
the latency of allocation and deallocation can increase by up to several orders of magnitude.
%be order-of-magnitude higher than \syscall{mmap} and \syscall{munmap}.



If the latency includes accessing every pages in between allocation and deallocation,
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:eval:pal:mmap-latency} (b),
the overall latency (including allocating, access, and deallocating pages) would
naturally be proportional to the allocation size.
The benchmark results show almost no difference
between the latency on the Linux PAL and in a native Linux process.
Because the benchmark only access the first words
of every pages,
the latency on the SGX PAL without page zeroing
is still lower than the Linux PAL.
If the SGX PAL zeros the pages after allocation,
accessing the first words
of every pages causes no additional overheads
on the overall latency.
