%The efficiency of \hostapis{} directly impacts the performance of \graphene{} on each host.
%A large portion of \linuxapis{} inside \thelibos{} require resources or abstractions from the host OS.
%Since \thehostabi{} is the only interface for requesting host OS features,
%the definition of \thehostabi{}
%restricts the options for a \picoproc{} to optimize its own performance, according to the application's performance patterns.
%Although each PAL may optimize individual \hostapi{} for general circumstances,
%all applications must share the same PAL ABI and thus tolerate the same overheads of exporting these \hostapis{} on each host.



The section evaluates the performance of \thehostabi{}.
The PAL ABI implementation depends on the existing system interfaces,
which partially determines the latency of each \hostapi{} 
%Upon a certain host, the base latency of a \hostapi{} is mostly determined by the host \linuxapis{} or abstractions
%chosen to implement such \hostapi{}.
%Three primary factors determine the efficiency of \hostapis{}.
%First, especially on Linux or other monolithic OS,
%most of \thehostabi{} are directly translated to similar \linuxapis{}.
%The efficiency of these \hostapis{}
%are dominated by the basic cost of the host system interface,
%and the performance of corresponding \linuxapis{}.
For instance, on the Linux PAL, the latency of \palcall{StreamRead} is comparable to the latency of \syscall{read},
since the former is mostly just
a wrapper of the latter.
If a \picoproc{} runs inside an SGX enclave,
the cost of enclave exits will increase
the latency of \hostapis{},
including the cost of copying data between enclave and untrusted memory.
%invoking a \syscall{read} \linuxapi{}, and returning the contents back to the enclave.
%The latency on the SGX PAL is then mostly dominated by the overheads
%of switching the context between the enclave
%and the untrusted, external PAL using SGX instructions,
%and bringing memory into the EPC (enclave page cache).
% or decrypting memory on a last-level cache miss.


In theory, the definition of \thehostabi{}
is meant to minimize the translation cost to most host system interfaces,
by adopting similar, UNIX-like semantics.
%Since most \hostapis{} are just wrappers
%of the underlying \linuxapis{},
%the translation cost is mostly reduced to simply replacing the generic identifiers and control flags
%to the semantics that are recognized by the host OS.
A major cost
in translation is to parse a URI (unified resource identifier)
for determining the file path or network address
%and compose a equivalent file system path or network address
to request host OS services.
%The second factor is the translation cost
%of the \hostapis{}.
%For portability, \thehostabi{} is defined with generic semantics, without host-specific notions
%such as process identifiers, file descriptors,
%file system paths,
%and \linuxapi{} flags.
%The PAL must translate the arguments of \hostapis{}, including PAL handles, URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers), and generic flags,
%to the arguments interpretable by the host kernel.
Other translation costs,
such as converting optional flags,
are relatively marginal, compared with the overall latency of a \hostapi{}.
%because the translation is mostly straightforward,
%and only requires simply logics
%and little memory copy.
%Without extra security checks,
%a \hostapi{} is more likely to suffer high overheads if the implementation
%requires additional \linuxapis{} for complementary operations
%to the base abstraction,
%or constantly retrying a \linuxapis{} at failures.



More significant overheads
on a few \hostapis{} contribute to security checks or enforcements,
to protect applications
inside host-specific threat models.
%for ensuring the safety of running an application
%within the threat model
%of a host.
%Finally, the third factor that impacts the PAL call efficiency
%is the cost of security checks,
%either inside the host kernel or the guest.
%The cost of security checks varies between hosts, and is correlated with the presumed security models.
For example, the threat model on a Linux host
focuses on the attacks between mutually-untrusting applications via system interfaces;
therefore,
the security checks on the Linux PAL
restrict the sharing of host resources and block \linuxapis{} that are not required by the Linux PAL.
%using both the reference monitor and \seccomp{} filter.
In another threat model, with the SGX enclave, 
security checks for each \hostapi{}
protects the application and \libos{} against malicious inputs from an untrusted OS,
%and thus focus on validating the results of \linuxapis{},
using either cryptographic techniques or semantic checks.
%Cryptographic techniques are used to: (1) validate the file against the secure hash, at \palcall{StreamOpen}, (2) check the file chunks against a Merkle tree of hash values, at \palcall{StreamRead}, and (3) establish a TLS connection over inter-enclave RPC, at \palcall{ProcessCreate}.
On the SGX PAL, the latency of a \hostapi{} may be dominated
by security checks,
especially the ones based on cryptographic operations.
%on large chunks of data exported to the untrusted OS.


The evaluation in this section is based on micro-benchmark programs similar to \lmbench{} 2.5~\cite{McVoy:lmbench}.
For each \hostapis{}, the evaluation also shows the breakdowns
of its latency or throughput,
by benchmarking the PALs both with and without the security mechanisms, such as the \seccomp{} filter and reference monitor on the Linux PAL,
as well as testing under different
implementation strategies.
The evaluation focuses on \hostapis{} that are especially sensitive for the performance of the \graphene{} \libos{}.
