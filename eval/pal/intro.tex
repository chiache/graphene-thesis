The section specifically evaluates the performance of \thehostabi{},
by benchmarking 
either the latency or throughput of \hostapis{}.
%on each host.
As the implementation of \hostapis{} largely depends on
the underlying host system interfaces,
\thehostabi{} is likely to share the same performance patterns
as the host OSes,
with various amount of overheads.

is the translation between \hostapis{}
and a host system interface,

%Additional translation costs
%may cause overheads
Other overheads include the costs of enclave exits or VM exits, and indirect performance impacts
caused by switching contexts between the host OSes and the \libos{} instances.
For \sgx{}, the latency of entering and exiting enclave can be up to \roughly{}7,000 cycles,
and enclave exits also cause TLB flushes and last-level cache pollution, which both downgrade enclave performance~\cite{orenbach17eleos}.

Enclave executions also suffer memory overheads
%especially since the PAL increase the enclave memory footprint.
%The memory access overheads
%results from 
for swapping memory into the EPC (enclave page cache)
or decrypting memory
at last-level cache misses.
%The latency on the \sgx{} PAL is then mostly dominated by the overheads
%of switching the context between the enclave
%and the untrusted, external PAL using \sgx{} instructions,
%and bringing memory into the EPC (enclave page cache).
% or decrypting memory on a last-level cache miss.
%This section
%evaluates the overheads of host system interface translation
%by comparing the performance of \hostapis{}
%with similar system interfaces on native Linux.


%In theory, the definition of \thehostabi{}
%is meant to minimize the translation cost to most host system interfaces,
%by adopting similar, UNIX-like semantics.
%%Since most \hostapis{} are just wrappers
%%of the underlying system calls,
%%the translation cost is mostly reduced to simply replacing the generic identifiers and control flags
%%to the semantics that are recognized by the host OS.
%A major cost
%in translation is to parse a URI (unified resource identifier)
%for determining the file path or network address
%%and compose a equivalent file system path or network address
%to request host OS services.
%%The second factor is the translation cost
%%of the \hostapis{}.
%%For portability, \thehostabi{} is defined with generic semantics, without host-specific notions
%%such as process identifiers, file descriptors,
%%file system paths,
%%and system call flags.
%%The PAL must translate the arguments of \hostapis{}, including PAL handles, URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers), and generic flags,
%%to the arguments interpretable by the host kernel.
%Other translation costs,
%such as converting optional flags,
%are relatively marginal, compared with the overall latency of a \hostapi{}.
%%because the translation is mostly straightforward,
%%and only requires simply logics
%%and little memory copy.
%%Without extra security checks,
%%a \hostapi{} is more likely to suffer high overheads if the implementation
%%requires additional system calls for complementary operations
%%to the base abstraction,
%%or constantly retrying a system calls at failures.

%under a specific host threat model.
%for ensuring the safety of running an application
%within the threat model
%of a host.
%Finally, the third factor that impacts the PAL call efficiency
%is the cost of security checks,
%either inside the host kernel or the guest.
%The cost of security checks varies between hosts, and is correlated with the presumed security models.
%The threat model for 
For most hosts including both Linux and SGX,

%using both the reference monitor and \seccomp{} filter.
For \sgx{},
\graphene{} further assumes a stronger threat model,
which distrusts any OSes, hypervisors and off-chip hardwares.

%Cryptographic techniques are used to: (1) validate the file against the secure hash, at \palcall{StreamOpen}, (2) check the file chunks against a Merkle tree of hash values, at \palcall{StreamRead}, and (3) establish a TLS connection over inter-enclave RPC, at \palcall{ProcessCreate}.

This chapter shows that
security checks on a stronger threat model like SGX
tends to impose high overheads
on many \hostapis{}.

The experiments in this section are based on an extended version of \lmbench{} 2.5~\cite{McVoy:lmbench}.
For each \hostapi{}, the evaluation %shows the breakdowns
