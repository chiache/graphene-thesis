\section{PAL ABI latency}

The section evaluates the latency of each \hostapi{}, including
the overheads of translating, isolating, and shielding each \hostapi{} from host \linuxapis{}.



The evaluation demonstrates several factors that impact the latency of \hostapis{}.
On a Linux host, most of \thehostabi{} can be directly translated to similar \linuxapis{}. For instance, the semantics of \palcall{StreamRead} exactly match with \syscall{pread}.
Without further security checks,
The latency of each \hostapi{} is comparable with the matched \linuxapi{},
except for minor overheads such as scanning file paths and translating network addresses from URIs.
For \graphene{}, the latency of each \hostapi{} includes
a small cost of context switch into the host kernel for \linuxapis{}.
For \graphenesgx{}, the SGX hardware imposes a fixed cost on each enclave call
for exiting and entering the enclave to use the host \linuxapis{},
which is order-of-magnitude slower than a \linuxapi{},
and a dynamic cost of copying data outside and inside of the enclave.
