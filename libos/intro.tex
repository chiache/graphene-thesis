\issuedone{1.1.a}{discuss the technical aspects of libOS}
This chapter
demonstrates how a library OS can be developed upon the host ABI,
to run unmodified Linux applications.
The major challenge in building the library OS
is to recreate the features of the Linux system interface, such as 
\linuxapis{} and namespaces, completely in a guest environment restricted by the host ABI.
There are two
main criterion for the library OS:
compatibility and performance.
Compatibility depends on
the richness of Linux features and API
in the library OS,
that are relevant to application execution.
On the other hand, performance of the library OS can be improved
by selecting the optimal emulation strategies,
based on the characteristics of the host ABI.
