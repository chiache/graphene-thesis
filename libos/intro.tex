\issuedone{1.1.a}{discuss the technical aspects of libOS}
This chapter
demonstrates how a \libos{} can be developed upon the host ABI,
to run unmodified Linux applications.
The major challenge in building the \libos{}
is to recreate the features of the Linux system interface, including
\linuxapis{} and namespaces, completely in a guest environment restricted by the host ABI.
There are two
main criterion for the \libos{} development:
compatibility and performance.
Compatibility depends on
the richness of Linux features and API
in the \libos{},
that are relevant to application execution.
On the other hand, performance of the \libos{} can be improved
by selecting the optimal emulation strategies,
based on the characteristics of the host ABI.
