\issuedone{1.1.a}{discuss the technical aspects of libOS}
This chapter
demonstrates how a practical, rich-feature \libos{} can be developed upon
\thehostabi{},
to run unmodified Linux applications.
The major challenge in building the \graphene{} \libos{},
\fixme{Use ``thelibos'' macro for the whole paper}
or \thelibos{},
is to recreate the features of the Linux system interface, including
\linuxapis{} and namespaces, %, completely in a restricted, guest environment. % restricted by \thehostabi{}.
There are two
primary criterion for \thelibos{}:
compatibility and performance.
Compatibility of \thelibos{} depends on
richness of the implemented Linux features and API,
%that are relevant to application execution.
while performance of \thelibos{} is determined
by the emulation strategies
based on characteristics of \thehostabi{}.
