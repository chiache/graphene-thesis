\issuedone{1.1.a}{discuss the technical aspects of libOS}
This chapter
demonstrates the development of a practical, feature-rich \libos{} based on
\thehostabi{},
for reusing unmodified Linux applications.
The major challenge in building the \libos{},
or \thelibos{},
is to recreate the features of the Linux system interface, including
\linuxapis{} and namespaces, %, completely in a restricted, guest environment. % restricted by \thehostabi{}.
For \thelibos{},
there are two
primary criterion:
Compatibility, the richness of Linux features and API,
%that are relevant to application execution.
and performance, affected by
the emulation strategies over \thehostabi{}.
