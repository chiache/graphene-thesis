%\fixme{define compatibility upfront; a lightning-rod definition}
%The compatibility of an OS is the ability to reuse the application code developed on the system interfaces.
%By introducing an additional compatibility layer as the library OS,
%the existing applications can be reused on a set of simpler, more adaptable interfaces.
This chapter will first describe a narrowed set of system interfaces, also known as the host ABIs,
which contain the minimal OS functions
needed on a host (i.e., an OS paired with a physical machine) in the OS design.
The discussion is followed by an overview of \graphene{},
a library OS built on the host ABIs for reusing the unmodified Linux applications, to improve the compatibility of the host.
