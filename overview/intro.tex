The compatibility of an OS is the ability to reuse the application code developed on the system interfaces.
By introducing an additional compatibility layer as the library OS,
the existing applications can be reused on a set of simpler, more adaptable interfaces.
This chapter will first describe a set of system interfaces (known as the host ABI), which are defined for adaptability on various OSes and hardware platforms. The discussion is then followed by the overview of \graphene{}, a library OS built on top of the host ABI, in order to reuse unmodified Linux applications.
