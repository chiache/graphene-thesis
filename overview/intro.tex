%\fixme{define compatibility upfront; a lightning-rod definition}
%The compatibility of an OS is the ability to reuse the application code developed on the system interfaces.
%By introducing an additional compatibility layer as the library OS,
%the existing applications can be reused on a set of simpler, more adaptable interfaces.
This chapter gives a overview of the \graphene{} library OS, as a compatibility layer to reuse unmodified Linux applications. For OS developers, \graphene{} reduces the development effort for achieving compatibility,
on an OS either developed from scratch or ported for new hardware.
%on an OS ported for new hardware or a new OS prototype.

The design of \graphene{} is divided into two parts: a host ABI (application binary interface) for porting to new host options, and a library OS for reproducing Linux functionality.
This chapter will first describe the design principles and overview of the host ABI. 
%A host ABI is defined to be ported to each host, with design principles to be both simple and sufficient for running the library OS.
%a narrowed set of %system interfaces, a.k.a. the

Then, we will discuss the library OS architecture, and the trade-offs between growing Linux functionality, optimizing performance and memory footprint, and security isolation.
