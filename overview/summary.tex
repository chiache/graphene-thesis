\section{Summary}
\label{sec:graphene:summary}

The \graphene{} design is centered around
building a para-virtualized layer, which can reuse the OS components for reproducing Linux system interfaces.
%instead of building arbitrary compatibility layers for reproducing the system interface.
%constantly porting the significant  of the existing system interface.
%In \graphene{}, 
\graphene{} defines a host ABI, as a new boundary between the OS and user space.
The host ABI is simple enough to port (containing \palcalls{} functions),
and exports sufficient functionality for virtualizing a primary part of the system API components.
A library OS is built upon the host ABI,
and implements \graphenesyscalls{} Linux system calls, to reuse unmodified Linux applications.
Using the host ABI, \graphene{} disconnects the complexity of reproducing system interfaces,
from resolving host-specific challenges in OS development.

Enabling legacy applications in a restricted environment,
such as \picoprocs{} or enclaves,
requires extra effort for mitigating the limitations of platforms,
in order to support typical OS personalities.
\graphene{}, as described in this chapter, extends the existing \libos{} designs
from isolating single-process or unshared abstractions
to include multi-process APIs required by many UNIX applications,
such as servers or shell scripts.
The challenge that \graphene{} primarily overcomes
is the requirement for coordinating shared states across multiple \picoprocs{},
to provides a collaborative, unified OS view.
Essentially, \graphene{} implements all shared, multi-process abstractions
and OS states
based on coordination over host-provided, pipe-like RPC streams.
The RPC-based, distributed OS implementation enables multi-process support in \graphene{}, with minimal extension to the host interface,
and a sweet-spot for enforcing inter-application security isolation,
by simply sandboxing the RPC streams.
Such a model largely reduces the complexity of
enforcing security isolation
on idiosyncratic multi-process abstractions
and shared states.
Because the corporative nature of \picoprocs{} in \graphene{},
an application can even dynamically impose sandboxing on one of its processes,
to reflect per-process, variable security policies.

In principle, we attempt to use \graphene{} to justify the platform independence
of the \libos{} design,
without sacrificing its qualitative benefits,
such as isolating mutually-untrusting applications
and a narrow attack surface to kernels.
\graphene{} implements a considerable number of common Linux system calls,
to support popular, modern applications
such as Apache web server, GNU Make, OpenJDK \java{} VM and the Python runtime.
\graphene{} translates the high-level system APIs used by applications
to a host ABI
inherited and extended from a previous Windows-compatible \libos{}~\cite{porter11drawbridge}.
In addition, we port the \pal{} (Platform Adaption Layer) of \graphene{}
to various platforms,
including FreeBSD, OSX, Windows, and even a more restricted environment, the \intel{} \sgx{} enclaves.
In particular, \graphene{} being ported to \intel{} \sgx{}
(\graphenesgx{})
can isolate applications --- either single-process or multi-process
--- on a host where neither the operating system nor the hardware (except the CPU package)
is trusted by the applications. 
Overall, \graphene{} shows that,
by simply porting the reasonably sized host ABI
to a new platform,
a whole large spectrum of legacy applications tested on the previous platforms
can be activated all together.
