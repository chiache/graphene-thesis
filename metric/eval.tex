Our implementation is summarized in Table~\ref{tab:syspop:eval}.
We wrote 3,105 lines of code in Python and 2,423 lines of code in SQL (Postgresql).
The database contains 48 tables with over 428 Million entries.

%{Due to the limitations of our approach,
%we cannot identify the system call numbers at 4.2\% of system call locations,
%and the opcodes at 3.7\% of vectored system call locations,
%among all binaries studied.}
%\fixmedp{I still don't understand what this means.  How did you know you missed some?}
%4.2\% of locations in binary 
%1,643 instances of missed/unknown system call instances
%and 2,212 missed/unknown vectored call instances.
% \fixmedp{What does this mean, exactly?  What does it mean to miss an instance?}
