The host ABI is a layer for virtualizing the system call implementation,
without complicating the porting of existing applications to innovative host OSes or hardware platforms.


\section{Basic Concepts}


The host ABI is similar to a para-virtualization layer, which defines the entire host features
available for implementing the library OS.
The traditional virtual machines reuse unmodified OS kernels on a virtual hardware interface.
Unlike a virtual machine,
the host ABI partitions OS components into the library OS, and retains only a set of basic OS functions to interact with the hosts.
The functions defined in the host ABI
are either API for requesting hardware resources, or convenient features, such as scheduling primitives, which commonly exist in many OSes.
%The functions in the host ABIs are similar to
%the UNIX-style API, or a small portion of POSIX,
The host ABI is selected as a pinch point for OS virtualization,
to recycle the virtualized Linux system call implementation, and to harvest the existing host OS functionality for porting the host ABI. 
%as a leverage point for harvesting the OS functionality implemented on the hosts.

%The \graphene{} host ABI defines a set of {\em functions}, similar to the API of UNIX or POSIX.
%The functions are directly called by the library OS, along with the arguments given either in the registers or on the stack.
%A host-specific \graphene{} loader is responsible for resolving the linking, from the library OS to the host ABI.



In general, the host ABI is defined as a set of function calls, with dynamic linking initialized at the creation of each process (or picoprocess).
The platform adaption layers (PALs)
are responsible for
resolving the calling addresses inside the library OS, and passing the function arguments and return values in and out of the host ABI.
By default, the host ABI in \graphene{} follows the Linux x86-64 calling convention,
which passes function arguments in six general-purpose registers (\code{rdi}, \code{rsi}, \code{rdx}, \code{rcx}, \code{r8}, and \code{r9}).
For other alternative hosts,
%If the library OS and the hosts share the same calling convention, the PAL can directly call
%the host ABI, without any redirection.
%For other hosts,
% that do not share the calling convention with the library OS,
such as OSX and Windows, the PALs redirect
the function arguments to the correct registers or offsets on the stack frames assigned by the calling convention.
Dynamic linking is beneficial for
building a pluggable, host-independent library OS binary, and leveraging the compiler optimizations across the host ABI.





%By definition, the host ABI is limited to the OS abstractions to the local process.

%Most functions in the host ABI
%only have local effect to a picoprocess.
%Using the host ABI, the library OS can  llocate a memory region inside the current picoprocess, or create a handle that is only accessible by the current picoprocess.
%Only functions related with stream I/O
%can share OS resources with other picoprocesses, such as writing to the same file, sharing a network sockets, or connecting through a local RPC (remote-procedure call) stream.
