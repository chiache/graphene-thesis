This chapter describes the formal definition of the \graphene{} host ABI.

\section{Basic Definitions}

The \graphene{} host ABI defines a set of {\em functions}, similar to the API of UNIX or POSIX.
The functions are directly called by the library OS, along with the arguments given either in the registers or on the stack.
A host-specific \graphene{} loader is responsible for resolving the linking, from the library OS to the host ABI.
