\section{Chapter Summary}
\label{sec:syspop:summary}

%Based on this study, we can draw several conclusions about the nature of Linux APIs.
%First, for any OS installation in our data set, the required API size
%is several times larger than the \syscallnum{} system calls in Linux, once one considers
%{\tt ioctl} opcodes and files under {\tt /proc}.  A solid two-thirds of system calls are indispensable.
%We show that a substantial range of system calls and other APIs are rarely or even never used.
%And the paper plots a rough guide for adding system calls to a Linux emulation layer or research prototype.
%
%We expect that this data set will be of use to researchers and developers for further analysis,
%Our methodology and tools can be easily applied to future releases and other distributions.
