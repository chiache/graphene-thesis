{\bf Abstraction} & {\bf Security Concern} & {\bf Strategy} \\

Fork & 
\raggedright
Files & Batch allocations of PIDs, children generally created using local state at parent.  \\
\hline
Signaling & PID to \picoproc{} map & Local signals call handler; remote signal delivery by RPC.  Cache mapping of PID to \picoproc{} ID. \\
\hline
\raggedright
Exit notification & 
\raggedright
Remote process status  & Exiting processes issue an RPC, or one synthesized if child becomes unavailable.  The {\tt wait} system call blocks until notification received by IPC helper. \\
\hline
{\tt /proc/[pid]} & Process metadata & Read over RPC.  \\
\hline
Message Queues & 
\raggedright
Key mapping, queue contents & Mappings managed by a leader, contents stored in various \picoprocs{}.  When possible, send messages asynchronously, and migrate queues to the consumer.\\
\hline
Semaphores & 
\raggedright
Key mapping, count. & Mappings managed by leader, migrate ownership to \picoproc{} most frequently acquiring the semaphore. \\
\hline
\raggedright
File System & 
\raggedright
File truncate sizes, FIFO files, domain sockets, symbolic links, file locks & No coordination, create special files in the host to represent symbolic links and file locks. \\
\hline
\raggedright
Shared File Descriptors & 
\raggedright
Seek pointers & Mappings managed by parent, migrate ownership to \picoproc{} most frequently accessing the file descriptors. \\
