\section{Decentralizing the Trust}

By migration-based process creation and
RPC-based inter-process coordination,
\sysname{} is able to support many multi-process abstractions in Linux,
as an inheritage from \graphene{}.
The states of multi-process abstractions are secured
by mutual attestation between enclaves that are part of an application,
and encrypting RPC streams used for coordination.
