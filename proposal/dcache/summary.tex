\section{Chapter Summary}
\label{sec:dcache:summary}

%This paper presents a directory cache design
%that efficiently 
%maps file paths to in-memory data structures
%in an OS kernel.
%Our design decomposes the directory cache into separate caches
%for permission checks and path indices, enabling single-step path lookup,
%as well as facilitating new optimizations based
%on signatures and caching symbolic link resolution.
%For applications that frequently 
%interact with the file system directory tree, these optimizations 
%can improve performance by up to \updatedbspeedup\%.
%% is an important task for 
%%modern OS kernels. \fixmedp{more justification?}
%%This paper demonstrates how this space used to cache the directory hierarcy can be put to even more effective use,
%%improving application performance by up to 30\%.
%Our optimizations
%maintain compatibility with a range of applications and kernel extensions,
%making them suitable for practical deployment.
