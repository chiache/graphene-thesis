\begin{abstract}

  Application partitioning is a technique to move sensitive data or code into
  a protected environment, such as an SGX enclave.
  Partitioning larger existing applications requires subtle reasoning that can be aided with static
  analysis and dynamic, language-level techniques.
  For instance, in-enclave code may include a library that memoizes results in the out-of-enclave heap.
  Using a managed, type-safe language like Java in SGX also brings the benefits of partitioning to a large body of 
  existing code. %, as well as help the developer with language-level analysis tools.
  Unfortunately, running Java partitions in SGX introduces a number of technical
  challenges, many of which arise from resource and system ABI constraints.
  To our knowledge, no prior work has even run a complete Java application in an enclave,
  much less partitioned a Java application to run a piece of application logic in the enclave.
%  That said, no amount of application-level analysis can protect against
%  a compromised OS, without 
  Thus, a number of technical challenges must be addressed to unlock
  the benefit to developers of combining managed languages with hardware such as SGX.

%% However, it is fundamentally challenging to

%Running a managed language in an enclave is difficult, and language tools

%much less integrated enclaves into the language's analysis tools.
%\fixmedp{check my claim. Too strong, or justified?}
%\fixmets{Since we are generalizing, we should only claim this is the case for sgx vs. Java. BTW, I prefer showing more certainty when making claims.}


%Application developers can place a library and sensitive data
%in an \intel{} \sgx{} enclave,
%but only if the library is a native binary, generally written in C.
%but must relies on developers to design invulnerable code.

%These language-level tools can be invaluable in ensuring a correct application partitioning
%and overall application correctness.
%Unfortunately, the most security-sensitive developers must choose between
%hardware and language security tools.


%% Using \intel{} \sgx{} enclaves, applications can
%% protect their most critical components from untrusted system stacks.
%% Language support for \sgx{} enclaves is a missing feature of existing \java{} Virtual Machines.
%% Using a managed language like \java{}
%% provides an opportunity to improve the weakest link of the enclave security---
%% application vulnerabilities that lead to information leakage.
%% \java{} language has effective framework to trace information flows, and provides type safety
%% to prevent memory access vulnerabilities in the enclave.
%% In addition, modularization in \java{} classes allows automatically partitioning
%% an application into enclave components,
%% minimizing the classes included in the enclave's trusted computing base.

This paper presents {\em \sysname{}},
a system that integrates \java{} language tools for partitioning applications
with run-time support for isolated execution in \sgx{} enclaves.
%\fixmedp{Any reason we can't do more than one partition in the enclave?}
%\fixmets{For an application, there is only one partition: the secure-sensitive part. We can create more than one instances in an enclave.}
%and which can execute a portion of the \java{} application in 
%a \java{} utility, runtime framework and API,
%that helps developers design isolated application components,
%and minimizes the attack vectors.
\sysname{} includes both \staticphase{} and \dynamicphase{} components.
The \staticphase{} tool, {\em \statictool{}}, uses code reachability analysis
to determine the minimal required \java{} classes for the isolated execution,
and helps the developer understand the complete partition interface. % between the application partitions.
%\sysname{} helps the developers generate an enclave image
%with minimal required \java{} classes for the protected code, reducing the TCB. %required for isolated execution.
%%\sysname{} includes language-level information flow control at the 
%%enclave border, protecting against unexpected exfiltration of secret
%%data due to application vulnerabilities.
The \dynamicphase{} framework, {\em \dynamicframework{}}, then launches the isolated execution of the enclave image
(a signed JAR archive) in an enclave when the untrusted part calls the interface.
Throughout the execution, \sysname{} enforces end-to-end isolation
on any object instantiated inside the enclave,
and leverages language-level information flow control to determine whether an object contains no sensitive information before the object is released from the enclave.
%to protect against unexpected ex-filtration of secret
%data. % due to application vulnerabilities.

%identifies information flow at the enclave border,
%preventing enclave secrets
%from being leaked due to any vulnerabilities.

%and narrowest interface for interaction.
%Second, the framework effectively prevents information leakage
%by forbidding any objects tainted by information flow to leave the enclave.
%In \sysname{},
%trusted servers may provision secure objects and classes,
%preserving security policy information. \fixmedp{Don't understand the previous sentence}
%\fixmedp{Do we want to say anything about contributing techniques to get good performance?}
%To secure \java{} applications, 
%With both the \staticphase{} and \dynamicphase{} language support,
\sysname{} also creates language-level abstractions of and extensions \sgx{},
such as attestation and provisioning, simplifying cumbersome aspects of this hardware
for developers.

%Finally, the API allows components in enclaves to be seamlessly provisioned with

We demonstrate the usage of \sysname{} with two applications: a SSH server with an isolated cryptographic library to protect its host key,
and a Hadoop framework capable of securely executing jobs using any secret, provisioned algorithm.
