  Asking developers to identify multi-level sensitivity, by marking the {\em entry classes}. Complete separation between isolated and untrusted classes.
  \\
  \midrule
  & Secure entry / exit of enclaves &
  Exporting public methods of isolated classes. Arguments are type-checked.
  \\
  \midrule
  & Integrity of the execution environment & 
  Packaging all supporting classes into a signed JAR.

  & Attestation \& secure provisioning & 
  Providing class {\tt Enclave}, to create secure channels and exchange attestation.

  \multicolumn{3}{l}{\bf Improvement from combining of \java{} language and the \sgx{} hardware protection:} \\
  \midrule
  & Memory safety \& control flow integrity &
  Naturally provided by \java{} language.
  \\
  \midrule
  & Reducing the enclave TCB &
  Automated partitioning based on class dependencies.
  \\
  \midrule
  & Preventing information flow leakage &
  Tracking information flow in trusted classes, only allow releasing the information if not tainted or declassified by developers.
  \\
  \midrule
  & Code confidentiality & Dynamically loading provisioned classes.
