%\fixmedp{I would start by motivating the goal of application partitioning.

An increasing fraction of applications handle sensitive data (e.g., medical applications)

These applications are composed of

hardware and hypervisors provided by an untrusted cloud provider.
{\em Application partitioning} is a technique to
run sensitive data or algorithms in a more carefully protected environment

%Why \sgx{}
%\fixmets{Bhushan's opening}
At the hardware level, 
new CPUs are offering features to protect application code and data
from a compromised or malicious OS or hypervisor,
%including the OS or hypervisor, or simply 
as well as isolate portions of a partitioned 
application's address space from the rest of the application.
Examples include \intel{} \sgx{}~\cite{sgx-manual}, 
%\fixmedp{Can we mention/cite others? IBM and ARM?}
IBM SecureBlue++~\cite{secureblue++}, and ARM TrustZone~\cite{trustzone}.
%are offering models of mutual distrust, which facilitate protecting
%an application from a
For example, \sgx{}
encrypts a memory region within an application, called an {\em enclave},
and restricts control flow into the enclave.
The encryption and attestation features of \sgx{}
prevent the OS or hypervisor from reading the enclave's plaintext contents,
and validate that the execution was correctly initialized, respectively.
\sgx{} also offers  protections against malicious devices off the CPU package,
such as a storage device or connectors.
In total, hardware such as \sgx{} is an essential tool for removing
large swaths of code from an application partition's trusted computing base (TCB).
%requiring only the trust in the CPU manufacturer, i.e., Intel.
%Remote attestation can also validate that an enclave was correctly initialized.
%Enclaves also provide remote attestation, where a client
%can ascertain whether the hardware is genuine Intel, and that the application was
%loaded correctly.

Application partitioning requires not just hardware, but also wise design choices
by the developer.
%Despite the fact that \sgx{} has restricted enclave entry points and execution paths,
%to a few pre-defined, application-specific entry points, 
%the developers still need to convince the users about the trustworthiness of the enclave
%by ensuring that the enclave does not inadvertently leak sensitive data.
%what those entry points should be, protect against 
%malicious inputs, and verify that code paths within the enclave that cannot
%inadvertently leak sensitive data.
For instance, 
%The fundamental issue is that
\sgx{} does not prevent the code in the enclave from
inadvertently copying sensitive data out of the enclave,
 such as if an imported library memoizes a result on the untrusted heap.
%accepting malicious inputs or copying data out of the enclave.
Iago attacks~\cite{iago}, where an OS offers malicious system call return values to compromise shielding layers,
have shown the difficulty of robustly sanitizing interactions with
untrusted code outside of an enclave.
%arguing the perfection of a system defending against malicious inputs. 
%are notoriously difficult to defend against;
%although limited countermeasures exist for the OS API, typically with the cooperation of a 
%trusted hypervisor~\cite{kwon2016sego},%\fixmedp{cite the asplos 16 inktag paper},
%there are no off-the-shelf defenses against Iago-style attacks from libraries
%or compromised application code.


%Complimentary to hardware protection,
Static analysis and other language-level techniques can provide the developer with
insights into how
to partition the application, as well as strengthen in-application separation~\cite{bittau2008wedge,brumley2004privtrans,khatiwala2006data}.
%\fixmedp{Can we bless some language-level app partitioning tools here?}
For instance, type-safe languages such as \java{}, C\#, and Rust can prevent memory corruption induced from malicious inputs,
as well as other attacks triggered by memory corruption (e.g., ROP attacks)~\cite{shacham2007geometry}.
Static analysis can also help the developer understand the transitive closure of all
library code they are importing into an enclave, or inadvertently calling outside of the enclave.
%while applications developed in C or C++ are often prone to memory-bug exploitation.  
%Because \java{} is memory safe, it is immune to known control flow attacks, such as return-oriented programming,
%where control flow is manipulated by unsafe writes to return pointers on the stack or function pointers in objects.
%protection prevents applications from being compromised by
%vulnerabilities that exist inside the applications.
%The vulnerabilities include mistakes made by developers, such as semantic and configuration bugs,
%and unbound application behaviors that can be exploited by attackers,
%such as memory attacks or control flow attacks.
%Based on the different languages used by developers,
%applications can be offered stronger language specific security guarantees.
Further, managed languages such as \java{} and C\# introduce new opportunities for using dynamic analysis to
reason about interactions at the enclave boundary, such as tracking sensitive data flows that might exit enclave memory.
%The compilers for these managed languages generate
%code structure in a intermediate form
%that developers can easily traverse and manipulate.
%Furthermore, \sgx{} is designed to run a small, native code library inside of a larger
%application; support for running managed languages in an enclave is currently limited.  
%Writing a security-sensitive application in an unsafe
%5language like C dramatically increases the risk of exploitable pointer or control flow errors~\cite{nergal2001libc,bletsch2011jump,checkoway2010return}, which ultimately disclose sensitive data or undermine the integrity of the enclave.




%Modern security hardware
%such as  provides hardware protection to applications
%especially the ones deployed in the cloud,
%so that the applications do not have to trust the privileged
%OS layer controlled by the cloud provider. 
%against malicious system stacks, including OS, hypervisors or devices. 
%In principle, these hardware techniques 
%Hardware protection between applications and their hosts is appealing
%in cloud computing, because the cloud client 
%need only trust the 
%the cloud provider's hypervisor can, in principle, 
%be excluded from the application's trusted computing base (TCB).
%These hardware protection is especially essential for cloud computing, due to the multi-tenant environment and potentially compromisable providers.
%\fixmets{I want to emphasize it can defend against hardware attack.}
%This type of hardware creates a sanctuary for the most security-sensitive
%components of an application---

%For instance, \sgx{} creates a encrypted memory region 
%called {\em enclave} within the memory space of an application,
%which can only be accessed by verified code from the users.
%\fixmets{I rather not emphasize partitioning so early, it's not the only way of using enclave.}
%\sgx{} lets the developer partition the application into two parts --- 
%security sensitive and non-security sensitive parts. The security
%sensitive part of the application is run in an hardware isolated
%sandbox called enclave, while the non-security sensitive part runs
%normally outside the enclave.
%% \sgx{} guarantees not only the integrity of loaded application image,
%% but also the confidentiality
%% of application data, %in enclave,
%% avoiding any information leakage to the untrusted exterior world.
%\sgx{} provides a fail-safe way to prevent information leakage from the enclave:
%by guaranteeing the integrity of a measured %and verified
%application binary
%and the confidentiality of application data in memory.
%the OS or hypervisor are simply stopped from peeking any application data, unless the isolated applications release any information.

%In general, hardware protection and language-level protection 
%provide separate security guarantees.
%Unfortunately, developers often struggle to combine both types of protection, due to the limitations and lack of support for both approaches.
%Even though type-safe languages like \java{} prevent the corruption of control flow from within the application, a compromised OS can still corrupt the application from outside to launch an ROP computation within a program.

This paper investigates {\em \sgx{}} and {\em the \java{} language} as a representative example
of combining hardware and language-level protections for partitioned applications.
We select Java because it is a very popular language: 
many existing applications are written in Java, and could benefit from partiioning into enclaves.
Similarly, x86 is a dominant ISA for cloud computing and other server platforms.
%Although other languages like C\# and Rust can also be good candidates for combination with the isolation hardware,
\java{} is both a type-safe language and a managed language;
is rich in language-level analysis and manipulation tools,
such as class mocking or information flow control~\cite{myers1999jflow, banerjee2002secure, hammer2006information, franz2008eliminating, chandra2007fine, smith2007improving, yip2009improving},
some of which this paper utilizes to improve application partitioning with \sgx{} (as listed in Table~\ref{tab:lang-comparison}).

One challenge for \java{}
is that 
\sgx{} enclaves are designed to run native binaries, primarily developed in C or C++ and compiled into x86 or x86\_64 machine code.
To our knowledge, no previous effort has even run a \jvm{} in an enclave, much less partitioned part of a Java application into an enclave
or exposed \sgx{} support to \java{} applications with language extensions.
%before loading into an enclave.
For example, VC3 uses \sgx{} to protect mappers and reducers in Hadoop framework~\cite{vc3}.
Although Hadoop is written in Java, the protected code in VC3 cannot be written in Java.
One could arguably get properties such as type safety from a language like Rust that does not require as much runtime support as Java,
but rewriting a large application in a different language is a significant obstacle to getting any benefit from \sgx{} hardware.
Our goal is not to let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

%Rewriting an application into  legacy \java{} application to C or C++, just for the purpose of partitioning, is a considerable effort that developers may be unwilling to pay.
%To our knowledge, no previous effort has even run a \jvm{} in an enclave, much less partitioned part of a Java application into an enclave.
%Even though \java{} is one of the most popular programming languages among commercial-class application developers,
%the current \java{} language has no API support for \sgx{}, making it extremely challenging to leverage the hardware in \java{} applications.
%Developers often have to create an ad hoc integration of hardware and language-level protection,
%or they are forced to exclusively expose the application between
%attacks from the system stack and vulnerabilities inside the applications.
%The state-of-the-art approach is to develop ad hoc solutions in C or C++, just to satisfy a specific application usage.
% approaches of combining
%language and hardware protection often rely on ad-hoc solutions that
%are specific to certain use cases or technologies.


%% dp: this sentence seems off track, unless you want to say something about ``this has to be in C''
%Similarly, S-NFV uses \sgx{} to isolate states of Network Function Virtualization Applications~\cite{shih2016s}.

%\fixmedp{Please check the previous 2 sentences for accuracy; if I'm wrong, try to say something more crisp.
%Also, any other important related work here?}
%to utilize \sgx{} hardware in language runtimes,
%a set of APIs may be exported through the native interface to support certain high-demand use cases, such as Hadoop workloads
%Although these existing solutions nicely support a part of the users,
%and potentially have demonstrated some common wisdom for combining the language and hardware protection,
%the problem of how to generalize the approach
%to cover more use cases or technologies that the authors haven't forseen,
%still remains unsolved.

%% dp: This paragraph is a little too much philosophy for me.  Cutting for now, but can bring some fo this back later in the intro if needed.  I think it would be better for explaining the benfits of Civet.
\begin{comment}
We use \sgx{} vs Java-based protection as an example,
to show how the guarantees ({\em what is secured?})
and features ({\em how is it secured?}) of hardware protection
can be properly modeled at the language level,
so that language protection mechanisms can be extended
to mitigate vulnerabilities in hardware protection. 
For instance,
\sgx{} hardware provides isolation between multiple
levels of security sensitivity in an application process,
by building another privilege level that bypasses the OS or hypervisor.
We model this hardware guarantee at language level by asking the developers
to identify the multi-level security sensitivity in the application.
The developers do not have to worry about
when to enter or leave the enclaves,
what information to flow out of the enclaves,
or even how \sgx{} enclaves fundamentally work.
The language features
such as implicit and explicit information flow tracking can be {\em leveraged}
by the low-level component that interfaces with \sgx{} enclaves
as the criterion for whether certain information
is safe to be released from the enclave.

%One solution to guarantee memory safety in applications is to use

%The solution to avoid the memory corruption bugs is to use a memory safe managed

%Moreover, Java is widely used to develop many enterprise applications,

This paper presents {\em \sysname{}},
a system that combines the benefits of

avoid the disadvantages of taking either approach.
\sysname{} includes both \staticphase{} and \dynamicphase{} components:
{\em The \staticphase{} tool}, or {\em \statictool{}}, guides the developers in partitioning an application,
such as identifying the complete enclave interface and code base of a potential partition.
%and offers analysis results for developers to  evaluate the minimality of partitioning.
Once the partition is finalized, \statictool{} generates an enclave image (a signed JAR archive) which includes the required classes for the enclave execution and exports the partition interfaces as the entry points to the enclave.
%ultimately generating an enclave image that includes
%a minimal Java code base;
The {\em \dynamicphase{} framework} includes a {\em \dynamicframework{}}, which loads and verifies the classes from the enclave image,
enforces \dynamicphase{} protection,
and filters information flow at the enclave boundary.
\dynamicframework{} also provides \java{} APIs for isolated classes to seamlessly access the \sgx{} features such as remote attestation and secure provisioning.
%a framework that help Java developers partition their code
%between security sensitive and non-security sensitive parts by adding a few lines of annotations.
%The framework automatically partitions the code into two separate binaries which are run 
%inside and outside the enclave such that the least amount of code as indicated by the
%developer annotations is run inside the enclave, and transparently creates 
%the necessary interface between the two parts. 
%% The interaction between the 2 parts of the application
%% is handled using \emph{reflection library}.
%% We perform dynamic information flow tracking 
%% and control the information flow at the endpoints of the \enclave{}.
%% By default, the framework automatically encrypts any object leaving the \enclave{}, but the
%% developer can override an endorser method to explicitly let some objects pass in the clear --- e.g.,
%% a ciphertext object. Based on information flow tracking, if an endorsed object is affected by some other
%% security sensitive data before leaving the enclave, the developer has to endorse it again.
%We use dynamic information flow tracking to enforce the policy that no information that is security sensitive or
%derived from other security sensitive information is flowing out of enclave in clear, without explicit
%developer directive.
%% Our framework provides ease of partition as well as makes it explicitly clear to the
%% developer when some information is flowing out of enclave in clear. 
%This ease of use and explicitness helps
%developer reason about the security of the code more clearly.
%\sysname{} achieves three properties: {\em security}, {\em practicality} and {\em usability}.
\sysname{} is designed to protect the confidentiality and integrity of 
real-world application code,
and to minimize the attack surface of the code running in the enclave.
%% dp: I think we should abandon tcb argument

%\fixmedp{I would refocus a bit on the contributions.  Make sure I don't overstate}
\sysname{} addresses design challenges at both the hardware and language level.
%one from each of hardware protection and language-level protection.
To extend hardware protection, \sysname{} contributes techniques for dynamically loading \java{} classes in enclaves
with the same code integrity verification as native, static binaries.
\sysname{} uses the \graphene{} \libos{}~\cite{tsai14graphene} to facilitate 
running a reduced \jvmname{} \jvm{} in an enclave.
%to facilitate and restrict the interface size of a 
%and prove the measurement of loaded classes as part of the hardware-generated attestation.
%Then \sysname{} verifies and attests loaded \java{} classes on the basis of measurement checking and attestation generation from the hardware.
%On the other hand, \sysname{} has to adopt language-level protection to enforce information flow policies against leakage over the border of enclave.
\sysname{} enforces information flow policies at the border of enclave by incorporating
Phosphor~\cite{bell2014phosphor} instrumentation on all classes in the enclave,
tracing both explicit and implicit flows from any confidential data,
and preventing tainted information from leaving the enclave by any interface, 
except via explicit declassification by the developer.
%either through exported API or low-level interfaces.

%We implemented the prototype for this framework and show three case studies 
%where this framework can improve security of existing Java applications. 
%Firstly, we show how to isolate a security sensitive library like 
%Bouncycastle in the enclave, so that it does not leak the secret key 
%used for cryptography irrespective of any bugs in the other part of the code.
%Secondly, we use this framework to achieve code confidentiality
%for any closed source library implementing proprietary or secret algorithm.
%Finally, we use the enclave to protect security critical data of a Java Web Start (JavaWS) application.

%As a proof-of-the-concept, 
This paper presents two representative examples of using \sysname{} for application partitioning.
First we partition and isolate the BouncyCastle~\cite{bouncycastle}
cryptography library and the host key from the rest of an SSH server.
%in which the  used for encrypting the connection
%is partitioned and isolated from the rest of the application, %in the enclave,
%protecting the generated session key while still
%using it for encryption and decryption.
Second, we present a Hadoop workload with a sensitive algorithm;
the %Partitioner%\fixmedp{what is this?},
Mapper, Combiner and Reducer classes are provisioned from a trusted server, protecting confidentiality of the sensitive code.
%always runs in an enclave.
%protecting the confidentiality of the running algorithm.
%Third, we present a data manager web application---a building block for medical and other applications that handle sensitive data; 
%we protect the secret client data in an enclave on the client's machine.
%\fixmedp{can we explain a bit more about the security property of interest?}
%which can serve as a web application for a website.
%
%\fixmets{I think not mentioning the Two Sigma and IBM examples in the paper---there is no reference, and their people might be sensitive about it. It's okay for mentioning to reviewers, but not in the paper.}
%Two Sigma runs private data center because their proprietary analysis code, which is written in \java{}, is too valuable to risk losing. Similarly, IBM Watson's proprietary code in Java also runs on private infrastructure. Hadoop running sensitive application written in \java{} is a very likely avenue for adopting \sysname{}.
%For each of the use cases, we show that developers or users
%can utilize \sysname{} to partition the applications
%with minimal effort
%and only an understanding of the isolation properties of \sgx{},
%not the cumbersome, hardware-level details.  %n{high-level understanding  knowledge of %almost no familiarity with how

%\fixmebj{Talk about killer apps for 2 sigma and IBM watson}
%\sysname{} prevents any bugs either in the untrusted application or the isolated crypto library to cause leakage of the encryption key.
%Another use case is a Hadoop job that is provisioned with a secret algorithm, and automatically encrypts computation results
%to eliminate risks of leaking the secret sauce.
